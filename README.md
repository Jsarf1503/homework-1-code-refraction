 I Moved the content class to where Search-Engine-optimization used to be to help cut out repetitive code
 replaced the original content class with just the class of main which helped clean up both the html and css 
 removed the comment over main to that way we could adjust the size of the the container that way it wasn't taking up the whole screen and the aside was able to come up on the screen 
 fixed a spelling error in the Benefit class
  moved styling from benefit-lead to just benefit 
  added display block, max width and margin to resize and realign the photos
  Changed text font to white 
  Used visibility hidden to keep the white filler space where the footer was 
  added alt tags to the images in  html
  replace the empty div container with a img tag and applied the class hero within tag
  changed the div container assigned the class of footer to the semantic tag of footer
  removed the class footer in css and just used the tag
